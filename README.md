# vmweb
RESTful API and web interface to vmlab.

# Disclaimer
The PHP here is procedural. I basically treated it as bash with web functions. Also, This is just an unfinished prototype. I became sloppy with javascript towards the end of the time I had available to work on this.

# Highlights
The best examples are probably interface/interface.js, api/v1/index.php, and database/procedures.sql.
